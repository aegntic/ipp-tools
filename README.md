### Intelligence
Data-driven frameworks based on analysis of 250,000+ high-performing content pieces across all major platforms.

### Psychology
Neurological triggers that bypass conscious filtering and speak directly to the deeper decision-making systems.

### Persuasion
Scientifically-validated influence patterns that create unstoppable momentum from first impression to final conversion.
